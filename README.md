# Express Sweater Weather
This project is a reimplementation of the project [Sweater Weather](https://github.com/Patrick-Duvall/sweater-weather) In order to learn NodeJS and sequelize. This Project is a RESTFUL API that uses Darksky and Google geolocation apis to deliver weather forecasts for a given city. It also supports user account creation and authentication using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) and [uuidv4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4)

###### Built Using 
- Jest
- NodeJS
- Express
- PostGres
- Javascript

### Initial Setup

To install on your local machine
- `git clone https://github.com/Patrick-Duvall/express-sweater-weather`
- `npm install` to update dependencies
- To expiriment you will need your own [Darksky](https://darksky.net/dev) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) API keys

### Running Tests
Testing is done using jest. To run the test suite run `npm test`

- Currently each request makes a Darksky and Google APIcall, should figure out a way to attach forecasts to cities.
